### A review

After a month trying Contabo, I must say that:

<span class="red-underline">Don't use their servers</span>.

Their storage bandwith policy is good, I will keep continue using it. But no way I'm go back for their server.

It's always down!

I have no idea why.

Their supporter is nice, but did not help.

### Solution

I'm going to use HostHatch for an experiment.

They have a lot of locations in Asia, like Hongkong, Singapore and Japan (with cheap price).

I'll comeback for more reviews.
