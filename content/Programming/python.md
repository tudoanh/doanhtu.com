Instead of trusting a coin I would propose to **learn the basics of all three of them** and then decide which one to master.  

You didn't say if you already know another language so I assume you want to decide which language to learn first, implicating you have no programming experience:  

* Python is a great and (mostly) easy to learn language. They say it's shipping with "batteries included" and for many cases that is just true. Definitely a good start to get into Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
* Javascript. Love it, hate it but there's no real way around it if you want to do web programming as it's the common denominator of frontend development. All you need to get started is you browser. Plus, you may get a bit of everything: event orientation, object orientation, prototypal inheritance, server-side programming with NodeJS
* Elixir is one of the hip and cool languages of today with growing popularity. It's a functional language offering something like an actor model to handle concurrency. For a (mostly) functional language it's got a nice syntax. Compared to, say, Haskell or Lisp. Elixir's USP is that it's running on the BEAM VM offering lots of features concerning robustness/fault-tolerance and scalability. None of which is really interesting to the average beginner.  

Summing up: Python is great to learn the basics of programming and will still do a descent job when it comes to complex problems. Definitely worth learning. Javascript is omnipresent today while being a sometimes strange mixture of many concepts but it's style is still comparable to Python. Many any means, learn Javascript. It's useful.  

Elixir is a different style. No OOP, at least not the traditional way. Processes, Message Passing.. it's a completely different style of even thinking about how to tackle problems. Definitely a great language (I am using professionally) but not exactly mainstream ;-)
