One day you don't know what to do anymore. The future is so unpredictable. Too much choices. You must make the decission.

Yes, the pain is real. The fear is real. You want to run away from it. Why should you suffer from those horrible feelings? You can find other thing to do, the "easier" things.

But don't.

Because each time you let them scare you aways, you learned nothing. You are not improved. *You are not lived*.

Change is hard. Makes you feel like everything you have done is wrong. You're failed. You must find a new way, a new approach, a new mindset to achieve your goal.

It sucks. But it's neccessery. It's the way nature works. Improvise, adapt, overcome.

And after all the hard works, the map of the real world will be updated. You know how things works now. It's awesome.

But it's a loop. Your believes may colapse again. The world changes. You must change, either.

I love this quote from Keynes. **"When the facts change, I change my mind - what do you do, sir?"**

And you sir, should do the same.
